Statistical cody for paper by Kimmich, Yeo, Zimmerman &amp; Furrer (2020) : How do sustained birth tears after vaginal birth affect birth tear patterns in a subsequent birth?

28. April. 2020
Just a few months off wrapping my MSc Biostatistics degree at the University of Zurich, this is what my biostatistics coursework contributed to, a brand new publication at the Journal of Perinatal Medicine, under the supervision of Dr. Eva Furrer, coordinator of MSci Biostatistics at the University of Zurich.

As we now know, we and our collaborators are the first to represent birth injuries as such in the #world. 

My favourite line from our article is :

"An understanding of the distribution of birth tear patterns will improve the clinicianâ€™s ability to counsel #women ... and #empower their decisions about birth mode"
